    "### Introduction\n",
    "This vignette goes through an example workflow using the `epictope` package. `epictope` facilitates the identification of optimal tagging locations for proteins of interest. Optimal locations are identified by considering four features; sequence conservation, secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and disordered binding regions. These four features are factored into a scoring function that calculates a cumulative score for each position in the protein. The weight of each feature and how they contribute to the final score can be defined by the user. Below, we work through a simple example of this workflow for a protein of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "To calculate the multiple sequence alignment and secondary characteristics, `epictope` relies on local installs of BLAST, muscle, and dssp. These packages can be installed using conda, an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Conda installers can be found at the Anaconda [website](https://www.anaconda.com/). Once installed, you may run the follow commands to install the requisite packages. These commands will create a conda environment named \"epictope\", and install the requisite packages into that environment. Alternative ways to install `epictope` dependencies are can be found [here](https://github.com/henrichung/epitope_tag#dependencies)"
