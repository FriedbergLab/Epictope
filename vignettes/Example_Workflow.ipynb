    "### Introduction\n",
    "This vignette goes through an example workflow using the `epictope` package. `epictope` facilitates the identification of optimal tagging locations for proteins of interest. Optimal locations are identified by considering four features; sequence conservation, secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and disordered binding regions. These four features are factored into a scoring function that calculates a cumulative score for each position in the protein. The weight of each feature and how they contribute to the final score can be defined by the user. Below, we work through a simple example of this workflow for a protein of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the multiple sequence alignment and secondary characteristics, `epictope` relies on local installs of BLAST, MUSCLE, and DSSP. The recommended way to run Epictope is through R or RStudio inside a conda environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verify installation\n",
    "To check if `epictope` has been installed correctly, we can attempt the load the package using \"library()\". If successful, the command should run without any further messages to the console. Once `epictope` has been loaded, we can use the provided \".FindExecutable()\" function to determine if the dependencies have been successfully installed and are identifiable by R. If successful, the output of each .FindExecutable command should list the file location of the program."
